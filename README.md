# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project-SpaceX-Analysis
This repository contains my IBM Data Science Capstone Project, where I performed a complete end-to-end analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches to predict the likelihood of a rocket's first-stage landing success.

The project integrates multiple data science methodologies, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, dashboard development, and machine learning prediction.

Objectives

After completing this project, I was able to:

Collect SpaceX launch data using APIs and web scraping techniques

Perform data wrangling and preprocessing

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL and Python

Build interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration

Use Folium for geospatial analysis of launch sites

Build a machine learning classification model to predict Falcon 9â€™s first-stage landing success

Project Methodologies
1. SpaceX Data Collection

Collected SpaceX launch data using the SpaceX API

Performed web scraping to extract historical Falcon 9 launch data from Wikipedia

2. Data Wrangling

Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis

Handled missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA using:

SQL for database-style queries

Pandas & Matplotlib for data visualization

Analyzed the relationships between launch parameters and rocket success rates

4. Data Visualization

Built interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash

Conducted geospatial analysis with Folium to visualize launch site locations and success probabilities

5. Machine Learning: Predictive Analysis

Built a classification model to predict landing success

Compared multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Trees

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports

Project Results
